If I had the financial means, I'd fly to a new country every month. Or even more often. Traveling is awesome. Even though my traveling is not very frequent now, I know about different services that will add comfort and peace of mind. To get from the airport to the city center, AtoB Transfer https://atobtransfer.com/italy/rome-ciampino-airport-taxi-transfers/ will be the best solution. And no financial scams. The price will be the same as when you book online.
